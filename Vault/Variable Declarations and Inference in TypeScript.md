# Variable Declarations and Inference in TypeScript

Declaring variables in [[Reference Notes/TypeScript|TypeScript]] is as same as [[JavaScript]].

```ts
let age = 10;
```

But, here, [[Reference Notes/TypeScript|TypeScript]] is able to infer that the type of the `age` variable is `number` using a concept called [[Type Inference in TypeScript|type inference]].
