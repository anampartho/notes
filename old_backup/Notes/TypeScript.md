#typescript 

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. It is a programming language built on top of JavaScript, which tries to fill the gaps of JavaScript. It is a strongly typed language whereas JacaScript is a loosely typed language. Though it is not a brand new programming language, it takes JS and improves it by solving pitfalls and introducing new features.

It is a powerful compiler that helps to compile TypeScript to JavaScript. So in a sense, it is a tool as well.
