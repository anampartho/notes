In object oriented programming, abstraction involves creating abstract members which can perform work in any complex manner (on the objects own fields, other objects etc) without exposing the members details to the user. This enables the user to build other complex logics using the abstract members without worrying about how that particular member was functioning.

For example: In modern days, we use mobile phones to make calls. We just input the number and press/click/touch a button which makes a call. Here we can assume, the os we are using has a class implemented for the call functionality where it has a `makeCall(double phoneNumber)` method. We as an end user, do not need to know the inner workings of the `makeCall` method. We just need provide a phone number and the method will make the call. This in theory is abstraction and the `makeCall` method is an abstract member of the parent class.
