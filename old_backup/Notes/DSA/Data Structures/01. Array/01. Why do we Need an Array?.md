As we know, basic variables can contain singular values of different type. In a strongly typed language, we need to mention the variables type as well.

```java
int id1 = 10;
int id2 = 12;
int id2 = 13;
```

If we look at the code above, we can see that, we are creating three different variables which contain ids of some kind. This is totally fine. But this can get messy pretty quickly. What if we want to store more than 100 ids? A single variable will not be sufficient in that case.

So to solve this issue, we can use an Array.
