We cannot store different types of data in an array when working with a strictly typed language like `Java`. The following is not allowed in `Java` as we are trying to store two different types of data (`String` and `int`) in an array.

```java
String[] users = { "Tashrik", 40 }; // This is not allowed
```

But, in a loosely typed language like `JavaScript`, we can store different types of data inside an array.

```javascript
const user = ['Tashrik', 40];
```
