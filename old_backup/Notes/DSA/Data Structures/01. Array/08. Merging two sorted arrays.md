Lets say we have two sorted arrays with length of `m` and `n`. We need to merge these two arrays in a sorted order. To do this, we will need another array which will be the length of `m + n`;

We will have three different index variables which will track the indexes of the three arrays. We will run a loop until any of the index gets bigger than the arrays last index or matches the length of it's corresponding array.

For example, we have `i` to track the index of array `a` and `j` to track the index of array `b`. If `i` matches `a.length` or `j` matches `b.legth` we will stop the loop. But if those are not matched, we will compare the values in `i` and `j` and based on the comparison take the value and put it into the third array `c`. Then based on the comparison, increment `i` or `j`.

After the above comparison is complete, at least one item will  remain either on array `a` or array `b`. So we will need to loop of through the remaining elements and put them inside the third array `c`.

> Complexity: `O(m+n)` - because we are looping through two different size arrays.

```javascript
const a = [1, 4, 6, 8];
const b = [2, 3, 5, 9];


function merge(arrA, arrB) {
	// Index variable
	let i = 0;
	let j = 0;
	let k = 0;
	
	const mergedArray = [];
	
	while (i < arrA.length && j < arrB.length) {
		if (arrA[i] < arrB[j]) {
			mergedArray[k] = arrA[i];
			i++;
		} else {
			mergedArray[k] = arrB[j];
			j++;
		}
		
		k++;
	}
	
	for (; i < arrA.length; i++) {
		mergedArray[k] = arrA[i];
		k++;
	}
	
	for (; j < arrB.length; j++) {
		mergedArray[k] = arrB[j];
		k++;
	}
	
	return mergedArray;
}
```
