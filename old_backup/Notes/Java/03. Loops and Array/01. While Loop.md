A `while` loop is a control flow statement, which lets the user to run a group of statements repeatedly if the condition is true.

To create a `while` loop the user initializes with a variable and after the statements of the loop body changes the variable so that the loop can stop at a particular time in the future. This also contains a condition to check. If the condition is `true`, then the body of the `while` loop will run. If the condition is `false` then the body of the `while` loop will not run.

So based on the condition, a while loop might not run.

```java
// Finding a factorial of a number
int factorialOf = 5;  // initialization
int factorial = 1;  
  
while (factorialOf > 1) {  // condition check
	factorial *= factorialOf;  
	factorialOf--;  // initial variable changes
}  
  
System.out.println(factorial); //120

```
