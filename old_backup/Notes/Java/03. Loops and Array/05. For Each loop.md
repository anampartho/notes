For each loop is used to loop through an array. While we can use a for loop or while loop, the for each loop gives us the value of each index in each iteration automatically. So we don't need to keep track of the index.

Syntax: `for (type value : valueArray) { statement }`

Looping an array using while, for, and for each:
```java
// While loop
int i = 0;
int[] myPoints = {10, 9, 10};

while (i < myPoints.length) {
	System.out.println(myPoints[i]);
	i++;
}

// For loop
int[] myPoints = {10, 9, 10};

for (int i = 0; i < myPoints.length; i++) {
	System.out.println(myPoints[i]);
}

// For Each loop
int[] myPoints = {10, 9, 10};

for (int point : myPoints) {
	System.out.println(point);
}

// 10
// 9
// 10

```
