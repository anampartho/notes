Sometimes we can use a class as a data only class. The only objective of this class is to carry data for the application we are building. This can cause some repeated boilerplate code. This means that we have to create a class and define its fields along with a constructor to set the default values. This can get repeated overtime.

To tackle this scenario, java has records. This helps us to define the data only classes more proficiently.

We use the `record` keyword. This is immutable, this means, after an instance is created we cannot change its fields.

```java
public record Student(string name, int roll) {}

Student s1 = new Student("Jhon", 2);

// Accessing the data
System.out.println(s1.name() + " : " + s1.roll());
```
