When a field is being used inside the class to manage any object instances should be encapsulated. This means that these fields should not be directly accessible or changeable. But to do that, we use accessors and modifiers, or simply put getters and setters.

## Accessors

Accessors simply fetch the data from a field and returns it:

```java
public class Burger {
	private String sauce;

	public Burger() {
		sauce = "barbecue sauce";
	}

	// Accessor
	public void getSauce() {
		return sauce;
	}
}
```

## Modifiers

Modifiers are used to change the data of a field.

```java
public class Burger {
	private String sauce;

	public Burger() {
		sauce = "barbecue sauce";
	}

	// Modifiers
	public void addSauce(sauce) {
		this.sauce = sauce;
	}
}
```
