## `this`

The `this` keyword simply refers to the current object instance. This is not mandatory but can reduce ambiguity.

```java
public class Burger {
	private String sauce;

	public Burger() {
		sauce = "barbecue sauce";
	}

	public void addSauce(sauce) {
		// we are using this keyword to reduce ambiguity
		this.sauce = sauce;
	}
}
```


## `null`

The `null` keyword means an uncreated object.

```java
Burger myBurger = null;

burger = new Burger();
```
