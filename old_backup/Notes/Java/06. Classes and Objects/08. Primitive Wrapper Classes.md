We know that the primitive data types on Java only contain the value. Because of that these values do not work the same as classes. This means we don't have any methods that these primitive data types provide.

Primitive Wrapper Classes on the other hand can hold primitive data but also provide useful methods as well. Java provides a wrapper class for every primitive data types.

For declaring a primitive data type of `integer` we used the `int` keyword. For the `integer` wrapper class, we use the `Integer` keyword.

```java
int a = 10; // holds the value
Integer b = 20; // holds the reference to the value
```

## Boxing and Unboxing

Boxing is a system which is used to convert primitive type to a wrapper class. This can work in both direction. In this case it is called **Unboxing**.

```java
int a = 20;
Integer b = a; // Java does boxing here. This happens automatically
```
