In $O(n \ log \ n)$ time complexity, the runtime of the algorithm is $n \ log \ n$ where $n$ is the size of the data.

## Code Examples

### Merge Sort

_In merge sort, if $N = 8$, then it takes $8 \times 3$ to complete the entire sort and merge process. We know that $log \ 8 = 3$ so this becomes $8 \times log_2 \ 8$ which in general is $n \ log \ n$ time complexity._
