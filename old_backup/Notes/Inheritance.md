Inheritance is a concept where a class can inherit methods and fields from another class. The class which inherits methods and fields from another class is called a subclass and the parent class is called a super class.

If the parent class has a constructor which needs argument(s), then the subclass in it's own constructor needs to call the constructor of the super class.
