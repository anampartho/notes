From wikipedia, Encapsulation refers to:
> the bundling of data with the mechanisms or methods that operate on the data. It may also refer to the limiting of direct access to some of that data. Encapsulation can be used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing direct access to them.

As we can see, encapsulation refers to the bundling of related members in a single unit and hiding some of those member to the clients. Only within the class those members can be manipulated with. This also referred to as the objects internal state.
