## The Primitives

1. `number` represents number values like `1, 1.1, -1`. There is no difference between `integer`, `float`, or `double` etc. Everything in js is a number.
2. `string` represents string values like `Hello World!`. Also `template literals` are strings as well.
3. `boolean` represents two values, `true` and `false`

The main difference between these primitives in javascript and in typescript is: typescript types are checked during compilation and js types are checked during runtime.
