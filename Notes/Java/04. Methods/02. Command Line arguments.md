When we create a class, there is a main method present. If we take a look at the parameters of this method, we will see that it takes in an array of strings. So when the file is run from the command line, after the name of the file we can pass comma separated list of arguments which will be stored inside the args array.

```java
public class Main {  
	public static void main(String[] args) {  
		for (String arg : args) {  
			System.out.println(arg);  
		}  
	}  
}
```

```bash
java Main hello world "Another String"
// hello
// world
// Another String
```
