A method is a block of code which can be used more than once. Methods are used to group similar tasks. For example, if we want to add two numbers we can create a method called `add` and write the code which will add the two numbers inside the `add` methods code block.

## Difference between function and method

There's a slight difference between a `method` and a `function`.

A function is a piece of code which is called by it's name. If a function called `add` is created, we can call it by `add()`.

A method is a member of a Class. It can operate on the data which was encapsulated by the object.

## Syntax

Every method returns data. So like variables, we have to mention the type of data a method will be returning before its name. Returning data is not required for a method.

Methods also can take in arguments. To allow arguments in a method, we need to define the parameters of that method. We also have to mention the type.

Arguments are passed by value. This means, if we pass a variable as an argument, the method body will copy the value of the variable and use that. It will not modify the original variable.

```java
// takes in two arguments, returns a double
static double addTwo(double a, double b) {
	return a + b;
}

// takes in not argument and does not return
static void justCheck() {
	System.out.println("Just checking!");
}

```
