# Relational Operators

Relational operators check the relation between two values. There are some Relational operators in Java.

| Operator | Literal               | Example                                       |
| -------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `>`      | Greater than          | `5 > 4` or `'c' > 'a'`                        |
| `<`      | Less than             | `4 < 5` or `'a' < 'c'`                        |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal | `10 >= 10` or `'a' >= 'a'`                    |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal    | `10 <= 11` or `'a' <= 'c'`                    |
| `==`     | Equal                 | `10 == 10` or `'a' == 'a'` or `true == true`  |
| `!=`     | Not equal             | `10 != 11` or `'a' == 'c'` or `true == false` | 

These operators always return boolean values. Either `true` or `false`.

## Ternary Operator or Conditional Assignment

Ternary operator consist of a `condition`, `?`, `:`, a code which will run if the condition is true, and a code which will run if the condition is false.

```java
// condition ? run-if-condition-is-true : run-if-condition-is-true

int c = 20;  
  
System.out.println(c >= 10 ? "c is greater than 10" : "c is less than 10");

// c is greater than 10
```

# Logical Operators

Logical operators produce a single `true` or `false` value based on two `true` or `false` values.

| Operator | Literal | Resolves to true           |
| -------- | ------- | -------------------------- |
| `&`      | And     | if both side is true       |
| `\|`     | Or      | if one side is true        |
| `^`      | XOR     | if _only_ one side is true |
| `!`      | Not     | If value is false          |

```java
int a = 10, b = 20, c = 15;  
  
System.out.println(a > b & b > c); // false
System.out.println(a > b | b > c); // true
System.out.println(a > b ^ b > c); // true
System.out.println(!(a > b ^ b > c)); // false
```

# Conditional Operators

Conditional operators look a bit like logical operators. But they behave in a slightly different manner.

| Operator | Literal | Resolves to true                                                  |     |     |
| -------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --- | --- |
| `&&`     | And     | checks the right side of the condition if the left side is true   |     |     |
| `\|\|`   | Or      | checks the right side of the condition if the left side is false. |     |     |
| `^`      | XOR     | if _only_ one side is true                                        |     |     |
| `!`      | Not     | If value is false                                                 |     |     |

```java
int a = 10, b = 20, c = 15;  
  
System.out.println(a > b && b > c); // false
System.out.println(a > b || b > c); // true
```
