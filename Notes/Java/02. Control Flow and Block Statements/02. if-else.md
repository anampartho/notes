By using `if` and `else` we can add control flow in our application. After the `if` keyword, we have to put a condition check inside two parentheses. If the condition check returns true then the code inside the if block will run. If the condition is false, then the code inside the else block will run if that is defined.

```java
boolean condition = true;  
  
if (condition) {  
	System.out.println("Condition is true");  
} else {  
	System.out.println("Condition is false.");  
}
```

## else-if

Along with `if-else` we can use `else if`. This works the same as the `if` statement. If the first `if`s condition does not return true, then the code will check the next `else if` (if defined).  The difference between `else` and `else if` is that, `else` does not check for a condition, and `else if` does.

```java
boolean condition = true;  
  
if (condition) {  
	System.out.println("Condition is true");  
} else if (!condition) {  
	System.out.println("Condition is false");  
} else {  
	System.out.println("Condition is none.");  
}
```

**NOTE: `else` and `else if` is optional**
