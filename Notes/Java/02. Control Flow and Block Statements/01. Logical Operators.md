There are some Logical/Relational operators in Java.

| Operator | Literal               | Example                                       |
| -------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `>`      | Greater than          | `5 > 4` or `'c' > 'a'`                        |
| `<`      | Less than             | `4 < 5` or `'a' < 'c'`                        |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal | `10 >= 10` or `'a' >= 'a'`                    |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal    | `10 <= 11` or `'a' <= 'c'`                    |
| `==`     | Equal                 | `10 == 10` or `'a' == 'a'` or `true == true`  |
| `!=`     | Not equal             | `10 != 11` or `'a' == 'c'` or `true == false` | 

These operators always return boolean values. Either `true` or `false`.

## Ternary Operator or Conditional Assignment

Ternary operator consist of a `condition`, `?`, `:`, a code which will run if the condition is true, and a code which will run if the condition is false.

```java
// condition ? run-if-condition-is-true : run-if-condition-is-true

int c = 20;  
  
System.out.println(c >= 10 ? "c is greater than 10" : "c is less than 10");

// c is greater than 10
```
