Block statement simply groups statements together. It creates a compound statement and also creates a scope. Any variables defined inside the block are not available outside it.

To create a block statement, we simply use `{}`. Inside the curly braces we create a block. For `if` statements we can see it in action.

```java
int a = 10, b = 20;  
  
if (a < b) {  
	// Inside the block  
	System.out.println("A is greater than B");  
} else {
	// Creating a variable inside the block
	// this variable will not be available
	// outside the block
	int c = 20;
	System.out.println(c); // 20
}  
  
System.out.println(c);
// java: cannot find symbol
// symbol:   variable c
// location: class Main

```
