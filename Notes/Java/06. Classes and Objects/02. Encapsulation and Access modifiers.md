Access modifiers simply mean if a member of a class should be available to be used outside of that class. There are three basic access modifiers:

1. No modifiers -the member will be available to be used within its own package.
2. `public` - the member will be accessible everywhere
3. `private` - the member will be accessible only inside the class where it was declared.
