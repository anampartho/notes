A constructor is a special method which runs whenever a new instance of a class is created. The name of the constructor is always same as the name of the class. Every class have to have a constructor method.

```java
public class Burger {
	// field initialiser
	String sauce = "barbecue sauce";

	// Constructor method
	public Burger() {
		// contructor body runs when an object
		// is initiated using this class.
	}
}
```

## Number of constructors

Every class must have a constructor. If we don't explicitly define a constructor, java will inject a constructor for us. The one java will inject will be an empty constructor.

Though every class must have one constructor, it is not limited to only one. We can have more than one constructor in class, but, each constructors parameters must be different. We can not have two different constructors with the same parameter list. This is called a signature. So, classes can have more than one constructor but their signature must be unique.

```java
public class Burger {  
	public Burger(String sauce) {}  // 'Burger(String)' is already defined in 'Burger'
	public Burger(String sauce) {}  // 'Burger(String)' is already defined in 'Burger'
}
```

IMPORTANT: If we explicitly define a constructor, then java will not inject any empty constructor. So if our defined constructor has a parameter, then when we create an instance of that class, we need to pass argumetns.

```java
public class Burger {  
	private String sauce;  
	  
	public Burger(String sauce) {  
		this.sauce = sauce;  
	}  
}

// Other file
// this will fail becuase the constructor defined in Burger class
// needs atleast one argument. To elude this, we can also define
// an empty constructor inside the Burger class.
Burger myBurger = new Burger();
```
