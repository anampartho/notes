A constructor is a special method which runs whenever a new instance of a class is created. The name of the constructor is always same as the name of the class. Every class have to have a constructor method.

```java
public class Burger {
	// field initialiser
	String sauce = "barbecue sauce";

	// Constructor method
	public Burger() {
		// contructor body runs when an object
		// is initiated using this class.
	}
}
```

## Number of constructors

Every class must have a constructor. If we don't explicitly define a constructor, java will inject a constructor for us. The one java will inject will be an empty constructor.

Though every class must have one constructor, it is not limited to only one. We can have more than one constructor in class, but, each constructors parameters must be different. We can not have two different constructors with the same parameter list or same types of parameter. This is called a signature. So, classes can have more than one constructor but their signature must be unique. So, if we define a constructor which takes one argument of type string, we cannot define another constructor which takes one argument of type string, even if the name of the parameter is different.

```java
public class Burger {  
	public Burger(String sauce) {}  // 'Burger(String)' is already defined in 'Burger'
	public Burger(String bun) {}  // 'Burger(String)' is already defined in 'Burger'
}
```

IMPORTANT: If we explicitly define a constructor, then java will not inject any empty constructor. So if our defined constructor has a parameter, then when we create an instance of that class, we need to pass arguments.

```java
public class Burger {  
	private String sauce;  
	  
	public Burger(String sauce) {  
		this.sauce = sauce;  
	}  
}

// Other file
// this will fail becuase the constructor defined in Burger class
// needs atleast one argument. To elude this, we can also define
// an empty constructor inside the Burger class.
Burger myBurger = new Burger();
```

## Constructor Chaining

In java we can also do constructor chaining by calling `this` with the parameters.

```java
public class Burger {  
	private String sauce;
	private String bun;
	  
	public Burger(String sauce) {  
		this.sauce = sauce;  
	}

	public Burger(String sauce, String bun) {
		// Calls the Burger constructor which
		// takes in one params which is a string.
		this(sauce);
		this.bun = bun;
	}
}

```

## Constructor visibility

As we are chaining constructor, we can hide a constructor to the user. We can use the `private` key so that the constructor cannot be used outside the class.

```java
public class Burger {  
	private String sauce;
	private String bun;

	// While creating an instance, we can no longer
	// pass only the sauce to create a Burger instance.	  
	private Burger(String sauce) {  
		this.sauce = sauce;  
	}

	public Burger(String sauce, String bun) {
		// Calls the Burger constructor which
		// takes in one params which is a string.
		this(sauce);
		this.bun = bun;
	}
}

```
