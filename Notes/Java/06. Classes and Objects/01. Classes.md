A class is simply a template which we can use to define new objects, object data, and methods. For example, we can say that a class is a category and an object is an item of that category. If we try to understand this with an example of burgers, we will see that there are different types of burgers, but all of them have the same features. They have buns, different types of sauces or meat. So we can say that `Burger` is a class and different types of burgers are objects (items) created by that class template.

We use this `object oriented` pattern to encapsulate the data and operations and share the usage semantics with the user so that they can use it.

## Defining a Class

We declare a class using the `class` keyword with the name of the class. A reminder: classes should not be `private`.

```java
public class Burger {
	// class members
}
```

## Class members

Each class can contain members. They are:
1. Fields - contains data
2. Methods - executable code
3. Constructor  - executable code which runs when an object is created.

```java
public class Burger {
	String sauce;

	public Burger() {
		sauce = "barbecue sauce"; // sets the default value of sauce
	}

	void makeBurger() {
		System.out.println("A burger with " + sauce + " was made!");
	}
}
```

## Using a class

To use a class we need to create a variable and assign the class name with  the `new` keyword. This creates a new instance of the class.

```java
Burger doubleDecker = new Burger();
```

## Classes are reference types

This means that when we instantiate a class and assign it to a variable, that variable does not keep a value of the created instance but keeps a reference to that instance. So if two variables are pointing to the same reference, one change will make the change appear in both variables.

```java
Burger doubleDecker = new Burger();
doubleDecker.sauce = "chilli sauce";
doubleDecker.makeBurger(); // "A burger with chilli sauce was made!"

Burger chickenSupreme = new Burger();
chickenSupreme.sauce = "hot pepper";
chickenSupreme.makeBurger() // "A burger with hot pepper was made!"

chickenSupreme = doubleDecker;
chickenSupreme.sauce = "hot pepper";

// The sause of doubleDecker was also changed because chickenSupreme
// had the same reference as doubleDecker object.
chickenSupreme.makeBurger() // "A burger with hot pepper was made!"
doubleDecker.makeBurger() // "A burger with hot pepper was made!"

```

## Initial State

State of a class is defined by its fields. If the class does not set the initial field value explicitly then Java will go ahead and give some initial values to those fields. These are the default values of those fields.

1. All `integer` types get a default value of `0`
2. All `float` and `double` types get a default value of `0.0`
3. `char` type get a default value of `'\u0000'`
4. `boolean` get a default value of `false`
5. Reference types get a default value of `false`

## Setting initial state

There are three different ways to set the initial state of a class.

### Field initialisers

Here we simply set the field values in the class body.

```java
public class Burger {
	// sets the default value of sauce hence this is a field initialiser.
	String sauce = "barbecue sauce";

	void makeBurger() {
		System.out.println("A burger with " + sauce + " was made!");
	}
}
```

## Static members

Static members are class wide. When an object is instantiated from a class, it will not copy over the static members of that class. The static members are shared throughout all the instances.

To create a static member we use the `static` keyword. The static methods need to be called using the class name.

```java
public class Burger {  
	private String sauce;
	private String bun;
	// this will be shared for all instances
	// if any one instance changes this, the change
	// will appear throughout all other instances
	private static int total;
	  
	public void order() {
		total += 1;
	}

	public int totalOrderedBurgers() {
		return total;
	}

	// This needs to be called using Burger.resetOrder()
	// we cannot call this on an instance. This can be
	// simplified using a static import
	public static void resetOrder() {
		order = 0;
	}
}

```

## Static import

Static import lets user to import the static method of a class. This can be done using the `static` keyword after the `import` keyword.

```java
// Making sure to only import resetOrder
import static comp.mysite.burgerapp.Burger.resetOrder;

// or

// Importing all static methods
import static comp.mysite.burgerapp.Burger.*;


// Usage
resetOrder();
```
