# Primitive Data Types

These are the data types which are built into the Java Programming Language. There are mainly four categories of primitive data types in java.

1. Integer
2. Floating Point
3. Character
4. Boolean

## Integer Types

These types only contain rounded numbers. No decimal numbers are allowed. The difference between each type is the amount of data they can store (Please don't try to memorize the min and max values!).

Reminder: To mark a long integer, we need to add `L` after the value.

| Type      | Bits | Min Value       | Max Value          | Literal Form |
| --------- | ---- | --------------- | ------------------ | ------------ |
| **byte**  | 8    | -128            | 127                | 0            |
| **short** | 16   | -32768          | 32767              | 0            |
| **int**   | 32   | -2147483648     | 2147483647         | 0            |
| **long**  | 64   | -2<sup>63</sup> | 2<sup>63</sup> - 1 | 0L           |

```java
byte maxItems = 20;
short currentSalary = 10000;
int yearlySalary = 120000;
long ditanceToNextGalaxy = 2147483648L; // This is not the distance to the next galaxy!
```

## Floating Point Types

These types only contain decimal values. These cannot contain rounded numbers. This is why these types are called floating-point types. The difference between `float` and `double` is the Smallest Positive Value and Largest Positive Value.

| Type       | Bits | Smallest Positive Value | Largest Positive Value | Literal Form |
| ---------- | ---- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------ |
| **float**  | 32   | 1.4X10<sup>-45</sup>    | 3.4X10<sup>38</sup>    | 0.0f         |
| **double** | 64   | 4.9X10<sup>-324</sup>   | 1.7X10<sup>308</sup>   | 0.0 or 0.0d             |

```java
float valueOfpi = 3.1415f;
double valueOfPiMoreAccurate = 3.141592653589793;

```


## Character Data Types

This type only contains a single Unicode character or its Unicode value.

```java
char firstCharMyName = 'T';
char letterT = '\u0054'; // T

```


## Boolean Types

This only contains the literal value `true` or `false`.

```java
boolean notUnderstandingJava = true;
boolean isJavaEasy = false;

```

# Type Conversion

There are mainly two types of type conversion in java.
1. Implicit type conversion
2. Explicit type conversion

## Implicit type conversion

When we try to do some operation that includes two or more types of data, java will try to convert those data as needed. This handling by the compiler is called implicit conversion.

For example, in the following code, we are not doing any type casting. Here, the compiler implicitly converts the string `'2'` into an `int` and gives us the ASCII value of it. Which is 50. Then adds 2 to it. So we get 52.

```java
System.out.println(2 + '2'); // 52 :P
```

Implicit conversion is always a Widening conversion.

| Datas                             | Action                                                             | Type     |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| Mixed integer size                | Converts the short integers type to match the large integers type. | Widening |
| Mixed floating point sizes        | Always converts the `float` to `double`.                           | Widening |
| Mixed integer and floating points | Always converts `int` to the largest floating point numbers type.  | Widening |
|                                   |                                                                    |          |

## Explicit type conversion

In this case, we explicitly tell the compiler, which type the data should be converted to. To do this the `cast` operator is used.

In the following example, we explicitly cast the string `'2'` to an int and get 50. After that 2 is added to it.

```java
System.out.println(2 + (int) '2'); // 52 :P
```

In explicit type conversion, we can do both Widening and Narrowing type conversion. Here we can explicitly change the `int` type to `short` or `byte`. This is called Narrowing conversion.
