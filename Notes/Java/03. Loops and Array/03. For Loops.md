For loops are more cleaner version of while loops. In while loop, we initialized the initial variable outside the `while` statemet and changed the initial variable inside the loop body. In for loops, we do these in one line.

```java
// Finding a factorial of a number - for loop
int factorial = 1;  

// We have moved the initialization, condition check and 
// initial variable change to a one line.
for (int factorialOf = 5; factorialOf > 1; factorialOf--) {  
	factorial *= factorialOf;  
}  
  
System.out.println(factorial); // 120

```
