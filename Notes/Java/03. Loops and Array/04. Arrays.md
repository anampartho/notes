Arrays are an ordered list of items. It can be used to store multiple values in one array instead of creating different variable.

To declare an array we define a type and add `[]` before the variable name. We can also define how many items the array will contain or we can dynamically add items to the array using `{}`.

```java
// define array with fixed items
int[] myPoints = new int[3]
myPoints[0] = 10;
myPoints[1] = 9;
myPoints[2] = 10;

// define an array without fixed size
int[] myPoint2 = {10, 9, 10};

```
