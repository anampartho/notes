Do while loops have the same principle as the `while` loop but it runs the loop body at least once, whereas the `while` loop runs the code body only if the condition is `true`.

In the following example, the do block runs even if the while condition is false.

```java
int myVal = 90;

do {
	System.out.println(myVal); // 90
	myVal -= 10;
} while (myVal > 90);

System.out.println(myVal); // 80

```
