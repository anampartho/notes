Enum (short for Enumeration types) is useful for defining a fixed list of valid values for some fields or data. Enum is used so that we can check that the data being fed to the field or methods are of certain value. This kind of works like a list of constants.

This can be declared using the `enum` keyword.

```java
public enum Grades {
	A,
	A_PLUS,
	A_MINUS,
	B,
	C,
	D
}

StudentGrade grade1 = Grades.A;

// we can do different conditional logics as well.
if (grade1 == Grades.A) {
	// ...code
}
```

## Relative Comparisons

Enums are not just a list of values. The items also have weight. Each items weight is defined based on where they are placed. The first item in the enum is lightest and the last item is the heaviest. This is ordered.

We can use the `compareTo` for relative comparisons. This method returns `negative`, `0` or `positive` values. This indicates the current instances order relative to another value.

1. `negative` means the current reference is lower than the compared instance.
2. `positive` means the current reference is higher than the compared instance.
