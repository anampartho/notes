Sometimes the type system of java is not enough to solve our problems. This can be because of the libraries we are using in the project or something else. We can manually solve this by manually supplementing the type system. But this is not the most proficient way. We need a structure way to express the context and intent.

Annotations are a special type that act as a metadata. This can be applied to a specific target. This does not change the behaviour of the target. These annotations need to be interpreted by the tools used or the execution environments.

We use the annotation by using its name with a `@` sign before it and then the entire thing is placed before the target.

```java
// uses the Deprecated annotation which affects the 
// methodName method
@Deprecated
public void methodName() {//...code}
```
