Map is an interface in the java Collections Framework. Elements of the map collections are stored as `key -> value` pairs. A map cannot contain duplicate keys.

## Common Methods

1. `V put(K key, V value)` -> takes in `key` of type `K` and `value` of type `V` and puts it into the map. Returns the old value which was in the `key` but returns null if there was no value present.
2. `V get(Object key)` -> takes in `key` of type `Object` and returns the value. Returns `null` if there is no `key` present.
3. `V remove(Object key)` -> takes in `key` of type `Object`, removes the item from the map and returns it. Returns `null` if the `key` is not present.
4. `clear()`, `size()`, `isEmpty()` works same as the other Collection interfaces.
