Polymorphism is a OOP concepts where it describes situation where a single thing can be of different shapes or forms.

For example, in java, every class is a subclass of the object class. So as it is an instance of the object super class, the subclass can also be considered as a Object type. If an object, passes more than one instance of checks, then it is a polymorphic object or it has many shapes/form.
