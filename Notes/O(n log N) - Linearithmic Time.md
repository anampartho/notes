In **`O(N log N)`** time complexity, the runtime of the algorithm is **`N * log N`** where **`N`** is the size of the data.

## Code Examples

### Merge Sort

_In merge sort, if **`N = 8`**, then it takes **`8 * 3`** to complete the entire sort and merge process. We know that **`log 8 = 3`** so this becomes **`8 * log 8`** which in general is **`N log N`** time complexity._
