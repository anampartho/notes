There are mainly two types of arrays.
1. Static Array
2. Dynamic Array

### 1. Static Array

This simply means that the size of the array is static. When ever the size of an array is decided at compile time, then it is a static array.

```java
int[] nums = new int[5]; // static array
```

### 2. Dynamic Array

This simply means that the size of the array is dynamic. When the size of the array is decided at runtime, then it is called a dynamic array.

```java
// we are taking some input from the user and puttin
// it inside the someUserInput variable.
int[] nums = new int[someUserInput]; // dyamic array
```

>** Note:**
> When creating an array in programming languages like C/C++ those are stored in stack, in java the reference variable is stored in the stack and the array data is stored in heap. To use the heap in C/C++ you will need to use a pointer and use the `new` keyword to store the array inside heap.
