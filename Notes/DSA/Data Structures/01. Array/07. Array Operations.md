## Display / Traversing the Array

> Complexity: O(n) - We are going through all the items.

To display all the element from an array we have to visit all the elements of an array one by one. This can be done using a loop.

```javascript
let myArr = [12, 4, 5, 2, 56, 90];

for (let i = 0; i < myArr.length; i++) {
	console.log(myArr[i]);
}
```

## Add(x) / Append(x)

> Complexity: O(1) - We are appending at the end of an array. 

To append, we mean that we will be adding an item at the end of an array.

```javascript
let myArr = [12, 4, 5, 2, 56, 90];

myArr.push(57); // Appends at the end
```

## Insert(index, x)

> Complexity: O(n) - We need to shift items from the given index to their right.

We can insert into an particular index using the `splice` array method of javascript.

```javascript
let myArr = [12, 4, 5, 2, 56, 90];

// At at index 1:
// 1. delete 0 items
// 2. insert 2
myArr.splice(1, 0, 2);
```

## Delete(index)

> Complexity: O(n) - We need to shift all the items from the right of the index to their left.

We can use the `splice` method of Arrays here, to delete an item from an given index.

```javascript
let myArr = [12, 4, 5, 2, 56, 90];

// At index 1
// 1. delete 1 item(s)
myArr.splice(1, 1);
```

## Search(x)

### Linear Search

> Complexity: O(n) - We are traversing through all the items to find x;

To search an item in an array, we can use built in `find` or `findIndex` method of Array provided by javascript or use a loop to find an item.

```javascript
let myArr = [12, 4, 5, 2, 56, 90];

const toFind = 90;

const foundItem = myArr.find((element) => element == toFind);
const foundIndex = myArr.findIndex((element) => element == toFind);
```

We can also use loops to find a particular element:

```javascript
let myArr = [12, 4, 5, 2, 56, 90];

const toFind = 90;

let foundItem;
let foundIndex = -1;

for (let i = 0; i < myArr.length; i++) {
	if (myArr[i] == toFind) {
		foundItem = myArr[i];
		foundIndex = i;
		break;
	}
}
```

#### Improvements of Linear Search

1. Use Transposition
	1. If the item is found at index `i` move it to index `i - 1`
	2. Move the previous item from `i - 1` to index `i`
2. Move the found item to index `1` or `head`

### Binary Search
> Conditions:
> 1. Array needs to be in sorted order
> 
> Complexity: O(log n) - we divide the array into two parts in every iteration.

We create three variables to implement. These are `low`, `high` and `mid`. 

The initial value of `low` will be `0` and `high` will be `array length - 1` and `mid` will be calculated using `(low + high) / 2` formula.

We will start looking at the `mid` index and then check if the item is greater or smaller than the item that we are looking for. Based on this value we will do the following operations:
1. If item at `mid` is greater than the item we are looking for:
	1. set `high = mid - 1`
	2. calculate new `mid`
2. else if item at mid is smaller than the item we are looking for:
	1. 1. set `low = mid + 1`
3. else if item at mid is the item we are looking for:
	1. Return the item
4. Return false

- Binary Search using `while` loop:

```javascript
const myArr = [1, 10, 14, 23, 34, 54, 65, 74];

const binarySearch = (arr, item) => {
	let low = 0;
	let high = arr.length - 1;
	
	while (low <= high) {
		let mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);

		if (myArr[mid] == item) {
			return mid;
		} else if (item < myArr[mid]) {
			high = mid - 1;
		} else {
			low = mid + 1;
		}
	}

	return -1;
}
```

- Binary Search using `recursive function`:

```javascript
const myArr = [1, 10, 14, 23, 34, 54, 65, 74];

const binarySearch = (arr, item, low = 0, high = 0) => {
	high = high ? high : arr.length - 1;

	if (low <= high) {
		let mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
		
		if (item == arr[mid]) {
			return mid;
		} else if (item < myArr[mid]) {
			return binarySearch(arr, item, low, mid - 1);
		} else {
			return binarySearch(arr, item, mid + 1, high);
		}
	}
	
	return -1;
}
```
