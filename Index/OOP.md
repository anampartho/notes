Object Oriented Programming or OOP is a concept where programs are designed/organised using objects. If a language is object oriented, then it means, that particular language uses objects and classes to group, define and manipulate interrelated data. Each class can contain members which gets copied over to the objects when an instance is created from the class.

These classes contain the definition or the process of setting interrelated data or field and methods for functionality. This gives the end user the capability of interacting or manipulating any publicly exposed data from the class, without knowing the internal implementation or how that data was set or changed.

There are four principles of OOP:

1. Abstractions
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism
